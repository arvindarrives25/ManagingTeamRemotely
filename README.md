# ManagingTeamRemotely
I have exprenice of more than 8 years in mentoring and managing teams geographally distributed(Pune, Kolkata, Australia and Philippines),
below are the points according to my learning and expreince 


### How to manage remotely distributed team(according to my experience)
* Try to hire people who are super passionate over super talented 
* Implement Scrum with Agile
* Give proper training on Agile and Scrum(With practical for example with some kind of funny games)
* Try to include atleast one or two people in the team from different region
* Try to arrange meetings/scrum/stand up calls etc. in such a way that people from different region can attend without streching their working hours
* Also try to make the team verstile so that it can be a combination of senior/mid senior/Junior 
* Try to make a common work culture so that all the team memebers from different region are on the same page 
* Try to create small small rotational roles apart from their job title to engage everyone for example scrum master or Product Owner etc.
* Create an environment where team memebers start owning their peace of work as their baby 
* Make sure meeting dont go too long or stressful, try to make it shorter and lighter, make jokes etc. to keep everyone awake, engaged and happy 
* Apart from planning meeting or Scrum meeting, try to organise a general meeting weekly or mothly where people can talk and share about their hobbies, what they have done over the weekend or what skill they are learning or if anyone want to share about family or their kids stories etc.
* Encourage team memebers to learn new skill/research and later may be present to team members or teach others 
* Create a work culture where helping team member to finish their task is a part of job
* Create result oriented/ time bound work culture instead of micro management 
* If you are implementing any new process or changing anything, explain the team that why you are doing that
* Encourage team memebrs to ask doubts and questions, also manager should open for taking any question no matter how silly the question is
* Value, encourage and appreciate team memebrs for their work, not just the manager but team memebers should also give shout outs to their co worker on a common open platform
* Always care for your team memebrs, ping them randomally ask about work or about family, make them feel that you actually care and value them 
* Always remeber in software company people are everything, try to make a happy and productive work culture
